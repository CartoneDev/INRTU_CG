## Pygame Starfield Simulation

A simple starfield animation using Pygame that simulates stars moving through space with dynamic brightness and continuous generation.

### Features
- Realistic star movement with perspective scaling
- Stars increase in brightness as they approach
- Infinite star generation
- Adjustable speed and number of stars

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CartoneDev/INRTU_CG.git
   cd INRTU_CG
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
